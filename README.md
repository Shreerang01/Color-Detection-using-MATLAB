# Color Detection using MATLAB

The need for sophisticated image processing applications is rising, which means that creating effective color detection algorithms is becoming more important. This example of color detection shows how to build a Simulink® model that can accurately identify pixels in an image that correspond to a certain color or color range. Using the Simulink Support Package for Android Devices, this model is made to make it easier to move from simulation to deployment on Android® devices.

This color detection model's main goal is to give users a reliable workflow so they can easily simulate, implement, and alter color detection methods. The model establishes the foundation for future development by correctly identifying pixels with the designated color during the simulation phase. In order to implement the model on an Android device, simulated data is displayed using the Video Display block, providing a useful illustration of the color recognition procedure.

This model's capacity to adjust to real-time photographs from the camera block is one of its unique features. By enabling users to engage with actual data, this improvement improves the model's relevance and application in real-world circumstances. The supplied methodology guarantees a seamless transition from simulation to real-world implementation, which makes it a priceless tool for academics, researchers, and developers who are studying color detection algorithms and how they are used in image processing.
